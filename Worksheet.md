# Create the skill and provision resources 
* Go to the Alexa Skills Kit at https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask and log in with an Amazon account

* Select “create skill” and enter the name that people will call your skill by (this is what you’ll ask Alexa for when you test the skill)

* Choose the “custom” skill model and “Alexa-Hosted (Python)” resources, then click “create skill” and choose “High-Low Game Skill”. We’ll use this as a template and add some new features to it

ASK will now create a basic conversation model for the skill and provision a Lambda function for your skill. This may take a few minutes. It should then place you into the ASK development environment. Time to get hacking!
